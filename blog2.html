    As of 2018, there are over 2,200 U.S. dollar billionaires worldwide, with a combined wealth of over US$9.1 trillion. That is more than the GDP of entire nations of some of the most advanced countries on earth, such as Japan, Germany or the United Kingdom. And what’s scarier is that the amount of wealth billionaires control has only been growing. Just in the year 2000, their combined net worth was below 1 trillion dollars; 3 years ago, it was 7.67 trillion dollars, and a year later (2018), it’s over 9 trillion dollars.
    So, the real question is: are you too poor for your age, or maybe you are ahead of everyone else? If you are let's say not a very good financial position, you can always change that, because it’s there right in your hands. Whether you’re fresh out of school, well into your career, or forging your path through life, it’s never too late to start saving or to check to see that you’re heading in the right direction.
    <div><h3>Calculate Your Net Worth.</h3></div>
    

<div>Calculation your net worth isn’t really difficult. It’s much easier than you might think. Take a piece of paper, draw a line in the middle of it. On one side, you have to add up the total value of your assets. This includes the current market value of your investment accounts, retirement savings, homes, cars, valuable things like jewelry, and the cash value of your checking, saving accounts.
    On the other side, write down your liabilities. This includes your mortgage, car loan, student loan, personal loans, credit card debt, 500 bucks you owe to your mate, and any other form of debt you might owe, and now finally, subtract your liabilities from your assets. The total cost is considered your personal net worth.
    Your total could result in positive net worth or negative net worth. If you’re in the negative new worth, don’t be afraid, it’s alright. It’s typical for people who are early in their careers to have a low or negative net worth if they have student loans, or are new homeowners, or are just starting to save for the future.
    If you are in your 20s and have zero savings, congrats, you’re doing not bad. I am not kidding, it's fine not to have any savings at this point in your life. Let’s face it. If you are in college and have student debt, your part-time job would hardly cover your bills, leave alone paying your debts. So, do not worry; most 20-year-olds have a negative net worth. However, that doesn’t mean you should not budget and make smart financial decisions because often it’s only later in your life; you will realize the consequences of your financial decisions.
